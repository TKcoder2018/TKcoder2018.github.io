                <h1> Oscar Wilde </h1><br><br>
          </div>
          
          <div class="main"><br>
              <p>  Most people concentrate on the wrong part of Oscar Wilde’s life.  Especially in our modern and twisted culture, the focus is on him as a misunderstood and persecuted homosexual.  True, he did engage in some homosexual acts and was sent to prison as a result (as he rightly should have been) but that should not be the focus of his life.  Wilde was a brilliant and very witty writer and speaker who sincerely enjoyed his writing and lecturing.  He was a strong advocate of the aesthetic movement and although not a practicing Catholic, throughout his writing you can see many references to Catholic morals and even to Christ Himself.  He seemed to have a Catholic conscience even though he did not act as if he did.
              </p>
              
              <p>  Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was born on October 16, 1854.  He was the second of three children born to William and Jane (Elgee) Wilde in Dublin, Ireland.  Both his parents were prominent members of Dublin society.  His father was a renowned eye & ear surgeon and his mother was an Irish nationalist poet.  When he was a year old he was baptized into the Protestant Church of Ireland, and then when he was about six years old he was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church .  He was taught at home by French and German Tutors until he was nine and then left for the Porta Royal School at Enniskillen a year later.  While at Porta Royal he did exceptionally well and received a scholarship to go to Trinity College which he attended from 1871 to 1874.  At Trinity he once more excelled in his studies, was at the top of his class, and received many awards and scholarships one of which was to Magdalen College, Oxford.  At Oxford he was introduced to aestheticism (loving beauty for its own sake), and under its influence Wilde’s now famous personality began to appear.   He attended Oxford from 1874 to 1878 and it was in his final year there that he wrote his first work, a poem called ‘Ravenna’, for which he won a prestigious award from Oxford.
              </p>

              <p>  In 1879, he settled in London where he started writing essays and poems for various journals and leading an extravagant life style.  And in 1881 he published his first book, which was a collection of his poems that gained him attention as a budding writer, he also met his future wife, Constance Lloyd, the same year.  Then, in 1882, he went on a year-long lecture tour in the United States where his lectures and poems where a much bigger success than in England.  After he finished in America, he did another tour in England and Ireland.  It was through these lectures that he became known as being a part of the aesthetic group.  In 1883 his first play opened in New York and he was engaged to Constance Lloyd.  They were married a year later.  His two children followed quickly with Cyril in 1885 and Vivian in 1886, both of them boys.  Around this same time he became editor for the once popular women’s magazine, Lady’s World, which he restored and brought back to popularity.  He also met Robert ‘Robbie’ Ross with whom he became good friends and was to have his first male relationship with.  After his second child, he and his wife decided to have no more children, due to the financial strain of it , and that is when his life went downhill.  Wilde had very strong sexual feelings, and now since his wife was unavailable and he did not want to have children outside of wedlock (like his father did), he went along when Robbie Ross introduced him to homosexuality.
              </p>
              <p>  Although his personal life had just taken a turn for the worst, his popularity was soaring and he was now one of the most sought after dinner guests in London.   In 1888 he published his first big hit, The Happy Prince and Other Tales, which was a collection of fairy tales.  And around the same time he quit as editor of Lady’s World so he could spend more time at his writing.  What is now his most popular and best known work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, was both his first and last novel, it was published in magazine form in 1890.  Although it was popular among his fans, it received a lot of bad reviews from his critics as being immoral.  A year later he came out with another edition, this time in book form.  It had six more chapters and a preface, and this time its reviews were significantly less critical.  After the Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde turned his attention to playwriting.  His first play, (Lady Windermere’s Fan), opened in 1892 and was an enormous success; his biggest success yet.  It was at this time that he met Lord Alfred ‘Bosie’ Douglas the son of the eighth Marquess of Queensberry (the same one that developed the rules for boxing), and began a serious relationship with him.  Then, in 1893, Wilde actually moved in with him, under the excuse of needing Bosie help with his plays .  This seemed believable because he came out with another hit play A Women of No Importance and started writing his play An Ideal Husband the same year he moved in.  In January of 1895 his play, An Ideal Husband, opened.  The Importance of Being Earnest opened only a month later and was spectacular.  By far his greatest piece, it was loved by everyone, and it got great reviews.
              </p>
              
              <p>  But now, at the peak of his career, his corrupt private life was to be the cause of his downfall.  Boise’s father, the Marquess of Queensberry, found out about him and Boise, and demanded that Wilde cease his affair or he would expose him and ruin his life.  Wilde and Boise changed nothing, so on February 18 Queensberry left a calling card at Wilde’s club calling him a “posing sodomite”.  Then Oscar Wilde made the biggest mistake of his life.  Against friends advice, he had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal libel.  Queensberry, however, knew that if he could prove that what he said was true then he would be found not guilty.  So Queensberry compiled enough evidence that not only acquitted him, but ended up convincing the crown to arrest Wilde on charges of homosexuality (which was illegal at the time).  Wilde was put on trial in April of the same year, but the jury could not decide, so there was a second trial at which time Wilde was found guilty and sentenced to two years hard labor.  Furthermore, since he had lost his suit against Queensberry, he had to pay Queensberry’s court fees.  This resulted in his house and all his possessions being sold to cover the cost.  His wife moved to Switzerland with their two children but surprisingly did not divorce him.  She did however change her name and that of the children.
              </p>  
              <p>Prison had an enormous effect on Wilde physically and mentally.  While imprisoned at Reading Gaol, he started to read works by St. Augustine, Dante and Newman.  You can see the changes in him in the letter he wrote to Boise while in prison, later published as De Profundis as well as in the piece he wrote after getting out, The Ballad of Reading Gaol.  Also, while in prison, Wilde had a fall which led to an ear infection that the prison doctor refused to recognize, but Wilde, being the son of one of the greatest ear surgeons, knew it was serious .  It later would be the cause of his death.  In May, 1897, Wilde was released from prison and the first thing he did was to write to the Jesuits in London begging a six month retreat with them.  When he received their refusal (on account of his unsavory reputation) he is said to have wept, so one can only speculate, what effect six months of Catholic reflection and spiritual guidance would have done for him, but as it was his conversion would have to wait.   
              </p>  
              <p>  The October after his release, he published his last great piece The Ballad of Reading Gaol.  This piece was based on his experiences in prison and was published under a different name.  He fled to France where he lived under the name Sebastian Melmoth.  He briefly met up with Bosie, but his wife and Bosie father both threatened to cut off their incomes if they remained together so they split up again.  His wife died in April, 1898, and Wilde wandered Europe while living out of Paris.  In early 1900, he went to Rome and received the Papal blessing, and later that year he contracted meningitis from his ear infection.  After receiving conditional baptism and Extreme Unction, he died on November 30, 1900 .
              </p>
              <p>  Oscar Wilde’s life is truly a sad story, but not in the way that modern people want to think of it.  He was an extremely talented man who had a few serious problems of which he repented in the end.  Although most movies and books about him exclude any reference to his death bed conversion, he did convert and had long been fascinated with Catholicism as can be seen with the many Catholic undertones to his writings.  He was not, however, a Catholic during his life.  But he should not be chiefly remembered for the immoral parts of his life, instead he should be primarily hailed as one of the greatest writers of the Victorian age.  Although Wilde’s life was filled with many problems, he should be remembered for his substantial and amazing ability as a writer.
