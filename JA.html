                <h1>Joan of Arc  by: Mark Twain</h1><br><br>

          <div class="main"><br>
              <p>  In 1896, Mark Twain wrote his book, The Personal Recollection of Joan of Arc.  Mark Twain first heard of Joan of Arc when, in his youth, he chanced upon some loose pages from a book about her, as soon as he read them he was immediately fascinated with the story of Joan of Arc.    Years later, when his career as an author was at a high point, he studied her story more thoroughly and decided to write a book about her.  He then spent twelve years researching the saint.  Much of that time he spent in France, investigating both the French and the English’s side of her story, so that his book would be historically accurate.  After writing it, he said that “I like Joan of Arc best of all my books; and it is best; I know it perfectly well.  And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing.  The others needed no preparation and got none.” 
              </p>
              
              <p>  Mark Twain wrote his book about Joan of Arc through the eyes of the fictional narrator, the Sieur Louis de Conte, Joan’s page and secretary.  He also published it under that name, because his readers had come to expect humorous fictional writing from him, and The Personal Recollection of Joan of Arc was the exact opposite.    The book begins with an introduction by the Sieur Louis de Conte (a childhood friend of Joan’s), who is looking back on the events that he witnessed surrounding Joan’s life, and relating them.  The book itself is divided into three books. The first book (In Domremy) is the story of Joan’s early childhood up until she leaves her village to go see the governor of Vaucouleurs.  She asks him to give her men and horses so she can go to the Dauphin.  In the second book (In Court and Camp) Joan, having gotten the men and horses from the governor, travels to see the Dauphin at Chinon.  The Dauphin is reluctant to see her, so he has her examined by the officials from University of Poitiers.  After that Joan finally gets an audience with the Dauphin, she then convinces him that she was sent by God, and that he must send her to relieve Orleans.  The second book goes on to depict her military campaign, still describing it all from the stand point of the Sieur Louis de Conte, it tells the story of the coronation of the Dauphin, and ends with her capture at Compiegne.  The third book (Trial and Martyrdom) has de Conte, along with another childhood friend of Joan’s, travel to Rouen where Joan’s trial is being held, so that they can be as close to Joan as possible.  De Conte then gets a job as an assistant recorder for “The Great Trial,” allowing him to get even closer to Joan than before.  Together they witness her trial presided by the infamous Bishop of Beauvais, Pierre Cauchon. 
              </p>

              <p>  Joan’s trial was in no way legal, or just.  Joan was allowed no counsel for the trial (even though she was a minor) so a nineteen year old girl, all alone, had to face a jury of fifty legal masters all set on condemning her, but Joan was able to defend herself quite skillfully.  Cauchon made up and twisted any information that he could so that he could use it against Joan, if he could not twist the information, he just got rid of it, as Joan herself said, “you set down everything that is against me, but you will not set down what is for me.”  Even the trial itself was illegitimate since Joan had already been tried by an Archbishop, at the University of Poitiers and had been found innocent, so Cauchon had no authority to re-try her.  But Cauchon ignored it all, and even managed to set aside Joan’s skillful defense of herself.  He tried her, and eventually had her convicted as a heretic.  On May 24, 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.  Ironically, she was not even executed according to the already illegitimate trial, for the civil judge who was supposed to pass sentence on her was so disturbed that he did not, he just told the executioner to do "what he was supposed to do".

              </p>
              <p>  Mark Twain greatly admired possibly venerated Joan of Arc he said that she was “easily and by far the most extraordinary person the human race has ever produced.”  The fact that Mark Twain would admire a Catholic saint so much, write such a work about her, and call it his best, is very strange, after all he was a well known criticizer of Christianity, and scorned any organized religion, having remarked himself “Faith is believing what you know ain’t so.”  Researching for and writing The Personal Recollection of Joan of Arc must have undoubtedly affected and impacted Mark Twain’s life.  How much it did, we will never know.  But he did seem more in favor of Catholicism after he wrote the book. In fact, in a letter to his wife he once said about Catholicism “If I ever change my religion I shall change to that.”   Although Mark Twain did not become a Catholic himself (he said he was a deist), it is obvious that he held Joan in high esteem.  He also gained a greater appreciation for the Catholic Church during his extensive research.  Further proof of his admiration for Joan was what he later said about her, “She is the wonder of the ages.”
