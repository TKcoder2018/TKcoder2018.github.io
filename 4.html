          <div class="main"><br>
              <p>  Actor, governor, writer, sports announcer, and President, Ronald Reagan was all of these and more, a truly remarkable man who did an amazing job where ever he was.  Public opinion holds him as the most popular President since FDR.  Elected as the 40th president of the United States, Reagan was a strong political figure and has been credited as being the cause of many influential and significant changes the world over.  His winning personality and ease of speech made him a popular and successful actor, as well as governor and president.
              </p>
              
              <p>  Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, the second son of John and Nelle Reagan.  At the time of his birth the family was living in Tampico, Illinois.  However due to his father’s drinking problem, and consequently difficulty keeping a job, they were constantly on the move.  Then in 1920 they finally settled down in Dixon, Illinois where his father opened a shoe store.  Strangely enough, although they were almost always in poverty and even with the constant problems at home due to his father’s alcoholism, Reagan recalls his childhood in Dixon as being the most joyful days of his life.   Nicknamed “Dutch” as a child, Reagan graduated from Dixon high school in 1928 where his love for acting first became evident, as he was in many of the schools plays.  Over summers vacation while he was at Dixon he would take a job as a life guard at the near-by Rock River where he is credited as having assisted over 70 swimmers out of danger.  After graduating high school he enrolled in Eureka College located in Eureka, Illinois.  Here, due to scholarships he got and numerous odd jobs he picked up, he was able to not only pay for college while he was there, but to also send money back to his needy family.   While at Eureka, Reagan was active in many aspects of college life.  Although only a passing student he was on the football team and swim team as well as participating in the drama club and being elected class president.
              </p>

              <p>  Once he graduated in 1932, Reagan got a job as a sportscaster for a radio station in Davenport, Iowa.  His skill on the job soon gained him a promotion to a bigger station in Des Moines, Iowa where he mainly covered Chicago Cubs baseball games.  In the spring of 1937 he was sent to cover the Chicago Cubs training sessions in California; however his intensions for going there were not entirely business related.  While in California he took a successful screen test for Warner Brothers studio and thus started his acting career.  While filming “Brother Rat” in 1938, Reagan met and became engaged to Jane Wyman whom he married in January of 1940; together they had one girl in 1941 and adopted one boy in 1945.  In the year 1940 he appeared in his first major noteworthy film, “Knute Rockne” in which he played George Gipp.  This role brought him the title “the Gipper” which stuck with him for the rest of his life.  In 1942 Reagan stared in “Kings Row” a remarkable film that was nominated for best picture.  Reagan’s performance in “Kings Row” brought him to the limelight of the acting profession and has been considered the very best of his acting career.  During World War II Reagan was drafted to active duty but his eye-sight was too poor to pass the tests, so he was assigned to take part in the production of multiple patriotic films.  Elected in 1947 as president of the Screen Actors Guild he became known for his anti-communist views and became active politically.  His marriage to Jane Wyman collapsed in 1948 partly due to her disapproval of him as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and also due to the fact that she was now at the height of her acting career and he was struggling in his post-WW II acting career, the friction between their careers put a strain on their marriage that it could not stand.
              </p>
              <p>  Although originally a liberal in his political views, Reagan gradually drifted towards the right, his second marriage to Nancy Davis in 1952 helped him in this transition as she was a strong conservative.  Even though Reagan didn’t officially change his status to Republican until 1962, he became very active in politics that were strongly associated with the Republican Party well before then.  He campaigned and gave speeches for many political figures before running for Governor of California in 1967.  His attention had always been on Federal politics but he saw the governorship as being a stepping stone to where he wanted to be.  He won the election in a landslide of nearly a million votes as the people were fed up with the previous administration and he had strongly played up his lack of experience as a fresh look at politics.  As governor, he was extremely popular and served two terms in office, he made many significant changes including clearing the large debt that had been accumulated.  In 1968 Reagan made his first go at becoming president although he came in third in the primaries, he was not discouraged as it had only been a test run.  Again in 1975 he ran for president but lost the nomination to Gerald Ford, however he was now a well known and likely candidate for the next election. In 1980 Reagan won the republican primary which set him against the democrat candidate Jimmy Carter.  However Carter was not in a very good position to win because of his many failings in office, most notably the Iran-Hostage crisis which had been going on for almost a year.   Reagan was able to soundly defeat Carter and interestingly enough the Iran-Hostages were released just months before he was inaugurated as the 40th president of the United States.  It has been speculated that Reagan’s firm and decisive stand on the matter played a significant part in the hostage’s release since their release coincided with the time that it was certain that he would become president.  Reagan’s presidential term had quite a kick-off when just 69 days after his inauguration he was shot by John Hinckley Jr. in an assassination attempt, however it was not fatal and his quick recovery and the sense of humor he displayed while recovering only endeared him to the public even more.  A fine example of his remarkable humor was when on the way to the operating room after the assassination attempt he remarked to the surgeons “I hope you’re all Republicans.” 
              </p>
              
              <p>  As president, Reagan worked hard to build back up Americas military which he said was sorely lacking; he was also firmly anti-communist referring to the Soviet Union as an evil empire.  The massive military he built up and the enormous pressure he put on the Soviets were significant factors in the downfall of the Soviet Union.  Reagan was quick to act in many world conflicts that he deemed needed American intervention.   Such as when there was a civil war in Lebanon he did not hesitate to deploy US marines to restore the peace, also when the Caribbean country of Grenada was overrun with Marxist rebels Reagan ordered American troops in to restore order.  When his first term was over he had absolutely no difficulty in getting re-elected defeating his opponent with an amazing 525 to 10 electoral votes.  In his second term Reagan was a lot more active.  In 1986 he ordered airstrikes on Libya after a bombing in Berlin (that had killed two American’s) was proved to have been due to Libyan terrorists.  However the most significant happenings in Reagan’s time as president happened in his second term in what is known as the Iran-Contra Deal.  In November of the same year as the Libya airstrikes, the Reagan administration sold weapons to Iran in exchange for hostages and then used the proceeds to support the “contras” in Nicaragua, an action that was in direct contrast to Reagan’s “no deals” standing during the election as well as being against a law passed by congress.  The two government officials that were blamed for the deal were fired and then an investigation committee found them guilty, but they were acquitted on appeal and Reagan accepted responsibility for the arms deal but claimed ignorance of the money sent to support the contras.   In 1987 Reagan delivered his famous “tear down the wall” speech at the Berlin wall, but it was not until two more years had passed before the wall was actually destroyed.  1988 was the last year Reagan was in office, during that presidential election Reagan pushed for his vice-president George Bush who ended up winning.  In January 1989 he officially resigned as President, just ten months later the Berlin wall came down.  The next year Reagan was on hand for the reuniting of the country at which time he took some symbolic swings at a remaining section of the wall.   Reagan retired happily to his home in Los Angeles, California where in 1994 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and then on June 5, 2004 he died at age 94 the oldest lived president at the time.
              </p>  
              <p>  Ronald Wilson Reagan was beyond doubt a remarkable man.  His career as an actor, which developed his ease of speaking and friendly personality, truly helped him to become one of the greatest presidents and political figures in the history of America.  Wherever he was in life, he won the respect and admiration of all he encountered, and by the end of his life, that included much of the world.  Reagan had a certain sincerity in the way that he presented himself that made him a very popular speaker.  He was not a politician, but an extremely honest, masculine, and patriotic man that truly believed all that he said or did was the right and best thing for him and for his country.
