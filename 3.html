              <p>  G. K. Chesterton was one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the 20th century.  Although he always considered himself a journalist, he wrote numerous works in nearly every genre of writing.  Some of the genres in which he wrote would include poetry, novels, essays, apologetics, detective fiction, critic, biographies, and public debates.  As the great writer that he was, he became a competent and respected authority in every field that he wrote.
              </p>
              
              <p>  Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in Kensington, London on May 29, 1874.  From 1887 to 1892 he went to St. Paul’s school in London, a private school for boys that would now be the equivalent of a high school.  Although he wasn’t the brightest student, while at St. Paul’s, there was a spark of his future greatness.  When only sixteen he started his own debate club; a year later he founded the club’s magazine.   After graduating from St. Paul’s he attended the Slade School of Art.  Around 1896 Chesterton started his first job in the literary field, working for a London publisher where he remained until 1902.  During this same time he began writing as a critic for several different magazines.  In 1900 he wrote his first two books (both poetry), and in 1901 he was happily married to Frances Blogg, the eldest daughter of a diamond merchant in London.  Together they then moved to a house in Beaconsfield where they stayed until the end of his life.  As an adult, Chesterton was frequently called an enormous man, standing 6 feet 4 inches and weighting around 300 pounds. There was truly was no other word to describe him.  His vast size combined with his keen wit gave rise to many quips about his immensity.  The most famous occurred during World War I when, after a public debate, a woman asked him why he wasn’t “out at the front?”  His quick reply was, “Go around to the side, madam, and you will see that I am.”.   He liked quality cigars and often had one in his mouth, tucked under his bushy moustache.  He was usually dressed in a cape and crumpled hat and carried a swordstick which he liked to flourish, especially when he was dictating books.  Rather absentminded, Chesterton often would find himself in a part of London and have no idea why he was there, in which case he would telegraph his wife.  The following was recorded in his autobiography: “Am at Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?” the story goes that his wife replied “Home”, however he did not record her answer in his autobiography. 
              </p>
          
              <p>During the Boer War, Chesterton, along with Hilaire Belloc, a close friend of his, were openly and emphatically pro-Boer, a rather unpopular opinion at the time.  He had always been an anti-imperialist and declared that the Boers where only protecting themselves .  Among his hundreds of books, thousands of essays, and numerous poems Chesterton wrote many biographies.  These were written on various famous people including, Charles Dickens one of Chesterton’s personal favorites.  At the time he wrote the first of his several biographies on Dickens, 1906, there was not much interest in Dickens and the biography Chesterton wrote on him sparked a renewed interest in the forgotten author.  Arguably the best novel he wrote, A Man Who Was Thursday, was written in 1908.  At this time he was already well known and respected as a journalist, debater, apologist, and critic.  His best known and most remembered character, Fr. Brown, was introduced when he published the first collection of Fr. Brown stories in 1911.
              </p>

              <p>  Chesterton had been raised as an Anglican but as an adult he had become fascinated with Catholicism.  When he finally converted in 1922, he said that the only reason that he had waited to convert was that he was “much too frightened of that tremendous Reality on the altar”.   Although he hadn’t actually converted until 1922, mentally he had already become a Catholic awhile before and it is apparent in many of his works.  The Everlasting Man written just three years later was one of his most influential books.  It and several other essays on apologetics are what aroused the then atheist, C. S. Lewis’s interest in Christianity.  In 1933, Chesterton was commissioned to write a book on St. Thomas Aquinas, so he told his secretary to get some books on St. Thomas, scanning through the first one, he put it down and then proceeded to dictate his spectacular biography on St. Thomas Aquinas.   The greatest Thomistic scholar of the 20th century, Etienne Gilson, said: “I consider it as being without possible comparison the best book ever written on St. Thomas. Nothing short of genius can account for such an achievement.”
              </p>
              <p>  G. K. Chesterton was without a doubt the greatest writer of the 20th century.  The reason being, he was the greatest thinker of the 20th century.  No matter what genre of writing, be it philosophy, apologetics, poetry, or even detective fiction, Chesterton was master of them all.  To quote Dale Ahlquist (president of the American Chesterton Society): “He said something about everything and he said it better than anybody else.”
