              <p>  The Hound of the Baskervilles, written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an action packed suspenseful book, and one of the greatest mystery classics ever written.  The story begins when the famed private detective, Sherlock Holmes, is called upon to solve a fascinating mystery concerning a legendary curse.  With his trusty friend Dr. Watson, Holmes sets out on one of the most dangerous and bewildering cases in his entire career.
              </p>
              
              <p>  A curse has hung over the Baskerville estate for generations, now another life has been claimed.  When an heir arrives, Holmes is employed to protect him and to investigate the recent death of the previous owner, Sir Charles Baskerville.  Unable to go himself, Holmes sends Dr. Watson to Baskerville Hall with Sir Henry Baskerville, the new owner.  Upon arriving, Watson discovers that the entire countryside is living in fear of the fabled Hound of the Baskervilles. While studying the case and the countryside as instructed by Holmes, Watson meets a number of interesting characters.  The most interesting being Sir Henry’s butler Barrymore, who seems to have an air of mystery hanging about him.
              </p>

              <p>  As the story progresses, Watson’s suspicions of Barrymore grow.  When Watson observes Barrymore walking through Baskerville Hall in the dead of night, and signaling out one of the window, he is set on solving the secret of Barrymore.  He investigates deeper but finds that Barrymore is only trying to surreptitiously help his homeless brother-in-law. With the mystery surrounding Barrymore cleared up, Watson follows a lead into the near-by village of Coombe Tracey.  After finding little of importance there, Watson returns to Baskerville Hall.  On his way back, he observes a small boy obviously trying not to be seen, carrying a bundle onto the moor.  Going to where he saw the boy, Watson finds a trail and it leads him to an old hut.  Sneaking up upon it, Watson finds it empty, but going inside he sees signs that it has been used recently.  Hearing footsteps outside, he hides in a corner waiting to find out who is coming.  The footsteps stop just outside the door and a familiar voice calls out to him.  It is Holmes!  

              </p>
              <p>  Why was Holmes there?  He had supposedly been unable to come.  Holmes tells Watson that he had just wanted to study the case in secret.  Holmes also tells Watson that thanks to Watson’s reports, combined with his own investigation, he has been able to uncover the identity of the man who caused the death of Sir Charles.  Furthermore he finds the killer is planning the death of Sir Henry.  Holmes tells Watson he has a plan to trap the murderer the following night.  He then gives Watson instructions concerning when and where Watson will need to be.  The following night, Holmes’ trap is a success and the murderer, a dangerous person, is no longer a menace to others.
              </p>
              
              <p>  From the time Holmes is called begins the case, to the grand finale when he catches the murderer, this mystery requires all Holmes’ cunning and skill to decipher.  A truly great book, this story has thrilled readers for countless years.  It has long been considered one of the greatest mystery classics ever written.
