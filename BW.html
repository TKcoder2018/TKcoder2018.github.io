                <h1>The Second Anglo-Boer War</h1><br><br>
          </div>
          
          <div class="main"><br>
              <p>If an average person was asked what the Second Transvaal War for Independence was, they would not have the vaguest clue as to what to answer.  If they were asked what the Boer War was, some might venture to guess that it was a small conflict between England and some African tribe, but most would still draw a blank.  However if a South African was asked what the second War for Freedom was, they would say it was one of the most unjust, avoidable, and unnecessary wars fought between civilized white countries, and one of the costliest and bloodiest in England’s history. Although most English history books claim it was, the Boer War was, in fact, not a just war.  The Boer War occurred when an alliance of the two Boer countries, the South African Republic (the Transvaal) and the Orange Free State declared war against Great Britain.  Beginning on October 11, 1899, it lasted until May 31, 1902 and cost over 70,000 lives (English, Boer, & native).  As with all wars, the Boer War was either just or unjust. St. Thomas Aquinas developed three widely known and accepted requirements that must be met for a war to be labeled “just”, and if you apply them to the Boer War it is easy to see it was not just.</p>

            <p>The word boer is Dutch for farmer; “Boers”, literally Dutch farmers, had originally settled in South Africa in 1652 as part of a Dutch East India Company shipping station/ colony.  Later joined by fleeing French Huguenots, they called themselves Afrikaners and considered themselves chosen people of God equivalent to the Hebrews in the Bible.  In 1806, during the Napoleonic War, the English officially took possession of the colony as a strategic location.  As the English started imposing their rule more heavily, the Boers began feeling oppressed.  When England declared the emancipation of all slaves in the British Empire in 1833, it proved to be the last straw for the Boers, who relied heavily on their slaves for their farms, and a great number of them traveled north in “The Great Trek” to escape English rule.  By 1854 they had gone far enough that the English had no desire to maintain control and they were able to establish the Transvaal (South African Republic) and the Orange Free State, and be recognized by England as independent countries.  However their peace was short lived; diamonds were discovered in 1870 which brought an influx of people (mainly British) to the area and led England to proclaim the Transvaal as an English colony in 1877.  But the Boers rose in revolt in 1880, and a year later, after inflicting a humiliating defeat on the English in the Battle of Majuba Hill, they re-obtained their independence and the first Boer War was over.  However, greed was to once more prove too much for the English and when gold was discovered in 1886 their attention was once more drawn to the two Boer countries.</p>
              
              <p>With the discovery of gold, people flocked in even greater numbers to the Transvaal and towns sprang up over night.  Eventually these people seemed to be outnumbering the Boers which caused much alarm among the Boers because the Transvaal had a democratic form of government.  If the English became the majority they could vote the Boer government out of office and the Boer’s would once more be under English rule.  This state of affairs led Paul Kruger, the sitting President of the Transvaal, to make it very difficult for the immigrants to gain citizenship.  The gold mines soon became the largest in the world transforming the Transvaal into one of the world’s richest countries.  Although mainly owned and operated by Englishmen, the mines were still under the control of the Transvaal, a fact which greatly disturbed the multi-millionaires who owned the majority of the gold & diamond mines in South Africa.  At this time the mine owners became very anxious for English control of the mines, and the English people in the Transvaal called for England to intervene and give them citizenship.  Also, several prominent English leaders favored the absorption of the Transvaal as an extension of the British Empire.  So Kruger knew what he must do.  The Transvaal began arming for war.</p>
              
              <p>The first hostilities broke out when Cecil Rhodes, one of the gold millionaires, ”unofficially” organized an armed takeover of the Boer government in Johannesburg in December, 1895, it failed, however, and only served to assure the Boers of the intentions of the English to gain control at any cost, even by armed force if necessary.  In 1897, Sir Alfred Milner was appointed as high commissioner of British possessions in South Africa.  Although given the task of calming things down and finding a settlement, his sole intention was to unite all of Africa by whatever means necessary under the British Empire.  Supported by England’s colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain, Milner ambition was to unite the continent “From Cape to Cairo” with himself governing it all.  Mistakenly confident that the Boers would be militarily no match for the English and would back down if bluffed far enough, Milner decided to force a war.  Backed by the mine owners and using the excuse of trying to gain citizen-rights for the English in the Transvaal, Milner convinced the English government that war was the only way and began building up the English army in South Africa.  In October, 1899 England issued an ultimatum demanding equal rights for English in the Transvaal.  Almost simultaneously Kruger, seeing war was unavoidable, issued his own ultimatum calling for the removal of all English troops from the border of the Transvaal in 48 hours or the Transvaal allied with the Orange Free State would be at war with England.  On October 11, 1899 his ultimatum expired without any response from England.  The war was on.</p>
              
              <p>The Boers were well equipped, very confident, and ready for the war but due to Milner’s underestimation of the Boers and the pitiful condition of England’s war office, the English army in South Africa was nowhere near big enough to defeat the Boers or even adequately defend the English towns.  Because of this the Boers were extremely successful in the first four months of the war, laying siege to three key English towns and decisively defeating the English in several major encounters.  It was not until the arrival of major reinforcements and new commanders in February, 1900 that the English began gaining victories and were able to relieve the besieged towns.  Now that they significantly outnumbered the Boer’s, the English were able to defeat their standing armies and capture the capitols of the two countries by June 1900.  Although the English thought this would break the Boer’s spirit and end the war, it actually did very little to bring the war to a close.  Almost the entire Boer army was mounted and therefore extremely mobile, and the Boers were experts a guerrilla warfare, plus they had a remarkable faith in God that he would bring them victory, so the capture of their capitols did little to hamper their movements or affect their morale and the war lasted another two years.</p>
              
              <p>Although the Boers standing armies had been defeated and almost all of both countries were under English control, the Boer guerrilla campaign proved very effective and there seemed to be no way for the English to defeat them because they stayed just outside their grasp.  But this changed when Lord Herbert Kitchener was made supreme commander of English armies in South Africa.  Arriving in November 1900, he had brought with him a new method for conquering the Boers.  He introduced a “scorched earth policy” by which he ordered that all the houses and farms in the area be destroyed, regardless of who they belonged to, and all the Boer women and children be herded into concentration camps so to deprive the Boer fighters of their support.  This, combined with the portioning of the land into sections with barbed wire fences & blockhouses, and the constant sweeping of the English army very gradually wore down the Boer fighting forces until on May 31, 1902 they finally agreed to surrender.</p>
              
              <p>According to St. Thomas Aquinas there are three points on which a war is judged as being just or not.  First there must be, “the authority of the sovereign by whose command the war is to be waged”.  His second requirement is “a just cause”.  Lastly it is “necessary that the belligerents should have a rightful intention, so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil”.  The absence of one of these requirements, according to Thomas, would make a war unjust and immoral to fight in.  Thomas references St. Augustine frequently to corroborate on the points he is making, and in The City of God Augustine himself talks about wars.  In it he states that: “It is the wrong-doing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage just wars”, this is another rule that, if broken, would make a war unjust.  The Boer War can be proven just or unjust by using these same conditions, when Thomas’ and Augustine’s requirements are aligned with the facts and chain of events that surround the Boer War one can clearly see that the Boer War, provoked by England, was unjust.</p>
              
              <p>The first of Thomas’ requirements is that there must be “the authority of the sovereign by whose command the war is to be waged”.  Looking at the Boer war, this requirement is met in so much as the English government declared war; however Sir Alfred Milner (High Commissioner of South Africa) staged the situation for them and arranged the facts in such a way that war seemed necessary and unavoidable.  So although it was the technically the government that made the declaration practically speaking it was Milner who “arranged” the war.</p>
              
              <p>A just cause is the second of Thomas’ requirements.  The real causes of the Boer War have been a point of much debate among historians; part of this problem is the conflict between what England claimed were the causes for it and the actual causes.   The main cause for the Boer War, as declared by the English government, was England’s desire to gain equal-rights for the immigrants (mainly English) in the Transvaal.  Now maybe they did deserve more rights, but it is wholly outside the jurisdiction of a foreign country to interfere in the internal affairs of another country and force its own agenda through violence.</p>
              
              <p>Another reason that England gave for the war was that she was better suited to rule Africa and teach the natives than the Boers were.  To some degree this is true.  The Boers had an incredibly strict segregation policy against blacks and treated them very badly.  Canon Farmer, an English Missionary, said: “I should be sorry to say anything unfair about the Boers.  [But] they look upon the Kaffirs (blacks) as dogs & the killing of them as hardly a crime”.  Many of the English leaders, however, showed no concern at all and some were actively hostile to the blacks.  In fact Lord (then Colonel) Baden-Powell (commander of the English forces in Mafeking & well-known for later founding the Boy Scouts), previous to the war, had written a popular book in which he boasted of his skill in what he called the “sport” of “nigger hunts”.  In addition, during the siege of Mafeking, in order to supply more food for the whites when he started running low on rations he selected a group of the blacks and gave them a choice: starve to death, or break through the Boer lines.  So although the English could and should have been better for the blacks, they were in fact not that much better.  An additional reason that was widely circulated and accepted in England was that the Boers were uncivilized and it was England’s job to civilize them.  This is probably the most ridiculous reason presented; the Boers were by no means uncivilized, in fact both the Boer countries had democratic governments and in the Transvaal, at least, divorce was illegal, drunkenness was nonexistent, and taxation of the citizens was at a worldwide record low.  And these have only been the official reasons for the war, the real reasons were much worse.</p>
              
              <p>The actual main reason for the war can be traced back to 1886 with the discovery of gold.  The gold mines in the Transvaal were the largest in the world, and with England being one of the financial giants of the world, having the mines so close yet out of their reach caused much worry among the many gold-made millionaires.  A well-known saying is that, “money talks”, this was proven once again in the Boer War.  Having some of the wealthiest men in the world begging for war and offering their financial support was too much for England whose colonial secretary (Joseph Chamberlain) and high commissioner of South Africa (Alfred Milner) already favored the extension of the British Empire.  It led them straight into war.</p>
              
              <p>The last of Thomas’ requirements is that “the belligerents should have a rightful intention, so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil”.  This requirement was definitely not met by the English in the Boer War.  In fact, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a prominent political leader and future Prime Minister of England, said at the time, "When is a war not a war? When it is waged by methods of barbarism in South Africa".  Surely there were many who took part in the war with right intentions and fought honorably, but as we have already seen many did not.  Lord Kitchener was probably the worst.  His ‘scorched earth policy’, which eventually brought the war to an end, consisted of him ordering the destruction of all houses, farms, livestock, and crops in the Transvaal & Orange Free State and the herding of Boer women & children into concentration camps where thousands died due to exposure, sickness, and malnourishment, at one such camp the annual death rate among prisoners reach 173 percent.  David Lloyd George, another future Prime Minister of England, declared: "It is a war not against men, but against women and children!"  Emily Hobhouse, an English woman, visited these camps and was so shocked that she was determined to inform the whole world of their horrors, a report she made to the English parliament included the following:<br><br>

<em>“A six month old baby [is] gasping its life out on its mother's knee. Next [tent]: a child recovering from measles sent back from hospital before it could walk, stretched on the ground white and wan. Next a girl of 21 lay dying on a stretcher. The father ... kneeling beside her, while his wife was watching a child of six also dying and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children"</em><br><br>

All total the number of people that died in the concentration camps is unknown but it has been estimated as high as 28,000, and children who were under 16 that died in the concentration camps outnumbered the men who died in action.  The horrors of the concentration camps shocked the civilized world, including England.  Mark Twain declared that it was, “A sordid & criminal war, & in every way shameful & excuseless”.  The English government received extremely heavy criticism.  This forced them to take drastic measures which greatly improved the terrible conditions but did not remove them.  Another great horror of the war was revealed in letters written by English soldiers, that were later published, in which it was discovered that although there was not an official order, the word spread that Boers were not to be taken prisoners and that they should be shot instead, many columns accepted this practice.</p>
              
              <p>The fourth rule for judging a war is Augustine’s rule, “It is the wrong-doing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage just wars”.  The failure of England to meet this requirement can be seen in the fact that England (through Alfred Milner) was “the opposing party”, and provoked the war.  William Mason, a Republican Senator from Illinois said that “the only way England could do it [fight] was to threaten, bulldoze, browbeat, and interfere with the Dutchman until, out of sheer humiliation and desperation, he was driven to fight.”.  The most glaring evidence of the way England provoked the war, is the failed peace talks of Bloemfontein May 1989, before the war.  Kruger and Milner had both been invited to a meeting in Bloemfontein by Martinus Steyn, President of the (Boer) Orange Free State, to talk through their difficulties and, if Milner had not been resolute to fail, the war might have never happened.  Although refusing to compromise at first, Kruger eventually produced a deal that was reasonable, very doable, and would have satisfied England in regards to the immigrants’ rights, but Milner, determined to fail, brushed Kruger’s deal aside and told his superiors in London that it had been unreasonable.  The questionable way that the war came about gave rise to much discussion and led Theodore Roosevelt to comment “I have been uncomfortable about the Boer War, and notably in reference to certain details of the way it was brought on”., and Mark Twain said about it: “I think that England sinned when she got herself into a war in South Africa which she could have avoided”  G. K. Chesterton, who was proudly pro-Boer, also stated in his autobiography that “The Boers were right in fighting”.</p>
              
              <p>The Boer War, as famously declared by Rudyard Kipling, gave the English “no end of a lesson”.  The fact that it took nearly 500,000 troops to defeat a country whose entire army, at its max, only equaled about 70,000 men (not including 15,000 foreign volunteers) would be laughable except for the countless lives that were lost.  The conduct of England in provoking the war and the way they carried it out all clearly indicate that it was an incredibly unjust war.  And if one considers the peace talks and Kruger’s proposal it becomes even more obvious.  Andrew Carnegie, one of the many who voiced their disgust of England’s role in the War, said it well: “The war against the Boers is infamous and unjust. The people in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have a right to self-government.”</p>
