          <div class="main"><br>
              <p>  Napoleon Bonaparte, known to his army as "The Little Corporal", was an amazing combination of military genius and political leadership.  Rising to power in the terror of the French Revolution, he restored order with a "whiff of grape shot".  An artillery officer by training, few military leaders can compare with him.  Starting with the ambition to conquer the civilized world he came close to fulfilling his dream, also becoming the master of Europe.
              </p>
              
              <p>  Napoleon Bonaparte was born August 15, 1796 in the small town of Ajaccio on the island of Corsica which was in the Mediterranean Sea.  His family, Buonaparte, later changed to the French spelling Bonaparte, was a noble Italian family.  At the age of ten Napoleon was sent to France to receive a military training.  After graduating as a second lieutenant he joined an artillery regiment, but spent most of his time on Corsica trying to help free it from French rule.  When the French Revolution broke out he began supporting the French Republic, in Corsica.  In 1793 the Corsican’s revolted against the Republic, and exiled Napoleon and his family from Corsica. Returning to France, Napoleon joined the revolutionist army.  When noticed at Toulon by the Republic’s head of the army (for his skillful handling of his artillery which had won the day) he was promptly promoted to general, and his rise to power had started.  After Robespierre was executed in 1794, the new committee replacing him found themselves threatened by the very mob that had put them in power, but they had an answer – Napoleon!  On October 5, he fired a "whiff of grape shot" into the mob, finally restoring order to Paris.  It was at this time that the committee decided that the only way to save the Republic was through a war.  In 1796 Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais, two days later he was given command of the army going thru Italy, a very wise decision for he soon proved that he was a very able general .  Establishing discipline was the first thing Napoleon did in his army, but he also knew that high morale was critical.  After an enormously successful campaign against the Austrians which took him almost to Vienna, he congratulated his soldiers and encouraged them to keep going with the following speech:
              </p>
          
              <p class="quote">"Soldiers!  In fifteen days you have won six victories, taken twenty-one standards, fifty-five cannon, several fortresses; you have conquered the richest part of the Piedmont; you have taken fifteen thousand prisoners, killed or wounded more than ten thousand men … deprived of everything, you have won battles without cannon, crossed rivers without bridges, made forced marches without shoes, bivouacked without brandy and without bread … The greatest obstacles are without doubt surmounted; but you still have cities to take, rivers to cross.  Is the courage of any of you weakening?  Would you prefer to return to the mountains and suffer the abuses of military slavery?  No-not for the conquerors of Montenotte, Millesimo, Dego, and Mondovi.  Every single one of you wants to extend the glory of the French race to humiliate those arrogant kings who dare to think of putting us in irons; to dictate a glorious peace which will indemnify the country for its immense sacrifices; everybody wants, on returning to their villages, to be able to say with pride: 'I served with the army that conquered Italy'."
              </p>

              <p>  “Cisalpine Republic” was the name of the government Napoleon set up in the territory that he had conquered, with him as its head.  He kept the directory from complaining by sending back treasure enough to overflow the treasury. It was in this campaign that he received the nickname ‘The Little Corporal’.
              </p>
              <p>  Napoleon next turned his attention to Rome and Pope Pius VI, who was an old man past 80 and partially paralyzed.  Early 1798 the French, under Napoleon, occupied Rome and took Pope Pius VI prisoner.  The Pope then spent eighteen months in captivity before he died in Valence, France.  When Napoleon suggested an Egyptian campaign, the French leaders gladly let him go for he was getting too popular, and powerful.  But although Napoleon easily defeated the Egyptian armies, the English navy under Admiral Nelson destroyed the ships Napoleon needed for transportation.  This incident led Napoleon to desert his troops and return to France with only a few of his officers.  In France, Napoleon overthrew the unstable French government and had himself proclaimed First Consul.  Napoleon ruled as a complete dictator and swiftly removed all opposition to his rule.  In 1802 Napoleon conducted the Concordat, a formal agreement between him and the Church, which re-established the Catholic Church in France.  An overwhelming vote by the people of France in 1804 caused Napoleon to become Emperor Napoleon I.  A magnificent coronation was planned and the new Pope Pius VII was to crown him emperor, but during the ceremony and before the Pope could crown him, Napoleon seized the crown and placed it on his head, showing that he had become emperor through his own power.
              </p>
              
              <p>  Now that Napoleon had become complete ruler of France for life, he wanted to become master of Europe.  Since he had already conquered most of Europe he turned to defeat his greatest enemy, England.  While preparing an invasion of England, Napoleon learned that the Allies, consisting of England, Prussia, and Russia, had put together an army in a desperate attempt to stop him.  So putting his invasion of England on hold, he went to defeat the allies.  In a series of brilliant battles, Napoleon totally defeated the Allies, becoming complete ruler of all the countries of Europe instead of having the countries be his allies.  Having defeated the allied armies Napoleon could once more focus on England.  But although he had an enormous army assemble for the invasion, he could not cross the English Channel until his navy had defeated the English navy.  But Napoleon’s naval admiral was timid; he did not want to engage the powerful English navy.  Since his admiral was not attacking the English, Napoleon decided to cancel his invasion of England.  Now he tried to defeat England by what was called the Continental System, which was declaring all Europe closed to English trade.  But the Continental System did not work very well.  Many countries did not go along with the system, Pope Pius VII for one refused to cut off trade with England, Napoleon then annexed the Papal States, Pope Pius then excommunicated Napoleon, and in return Napoleon had his soldiers take the Pope prisoner.  Other country’s that did not go along with the Continental System included Russia, which had been Napoleon’s ally.  This led Napoleon to declare war on Russia.  In Russia began the defeat of Napoleon.
              </p>  
              <p>In 1812, Napoleon entered Russia with the largest army in history, thinking he would win a couple of decisive battles and disperse the Russian army.  But the Russians did not stand and fight, they retreated deep into Russia, while retreating they practiced a scorched earth policy, burning everything as they went, so Napoleon could not get any of the supplies he needed.  Then the Russian winter set in.  Napoleon took possession of Moscow thinking he could use it as winter quarters for his army, but the Russians had deserted it and burned it to the ground.  With Moscow gone, Napoleon decided to retreat.  It was the middle of the winter, and Napoleon’s soldiers were not equipped for a Russian winter. On the long trek back his soldiers had to march in the intense cold without food, and many had make-shift shoes.  On this long and horrible journey out of Russia the Russian army attacked, inflicting terrible casualties on Napoleon’s army, only one sixth of Napoleon magnificent army ever made it back.  Napoleon once again deserted his army and sped ahead to Poland.  In Poland he tried to build his army back up with raw recruits, but he could not train them in time, because the Allies had once again raised an army to stop him.  This time they succeeded.  In 1814 Emperor Napoleon I abdicated in favor of his son Napoleon II, but the allies refused to recognize him.  The once mighty master of Europe was now reduced to a small island named Elba.  Pope Pius VII was then released, and able to return to Rome.  In 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France with an army that could easily have been stopped.  But when a force of French soldiers was led against him, the French soldiers rallied to his standard and deserted the leader they had come with.  And so began Napoleon’s ‘hundred day rule’ which ended with his total defeat at Waterloo.  He was then made prisoner on the lonely and remote island of St. Helena, where he stayed until his death in 1821.

              <p>  Napoleon Bonaparte was a truly brilliant commander and political leader.  There are few military leaders who can compare with The Little Corporal.  He began his career when he graduated military school as an artillery officer, and ended it twenty-nine years later at the significant battle of Waterloo.  His amazing Austrian campaign is still studied today at West Point.  As master of Europe, he came very close to fulfilling his dream of becoming ruler of the world.
