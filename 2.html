              <p>  William Shakespeare has long been considered one of the greatest dramatists the world has ever known.  His works have been translated into every major language, and have been performed the world over.  His incredible ability as a writer is clearly evident in his many celebrated works.
              </p>
              
              <p>  William Shakespeare was born in the year 1564, and although the specific date of his birth is unknown, it is known that he was baptized in Stratford-upon-Avon, on April 26.  His father, John Shakespeare, was a wealthy glove maker who held a number of important positions in the town.  John Shakespeare had married Mary Arden; the daughter of a landowner near Stratford, and William was their third child.  Although little is known about William Shakespeare’s childhood, it is very likely that he attended the local grammar school, where he primarily studied Latin, until he was about fourteen.
              </p>
          
              <p>  When Shakespeare was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway who was twenty-six.  Shakespeare and Anne had three children.  Susanna, their first child, was born in 1583. Twins, Judith and Hamnet, were born in 1585.  Little is known about the time from when the twins were born to when he started writing, but by 1592 he was well established in London as an actor and author.  He had also already written one of his more noteworthy works, based on the life of King Henry VI.  Due to a plague, the London playhouses where Shakespeare worked were closed for two years.  During that time, Shakespeare wrote two lengthy poems, they were his first works to be published.  In 1596 Shakespeare’s father was granted a coat of arms undoubtedly due to Shakespeare; this is unmistakable evidence that Shakespeare had begun to prosper early. 
              </p>

              <p>  From approximately 1594 to the end of his career, Shakespeare belonged to the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, the most successful theatrical group in London.  Between the years of 1594 and 1608, Shakespeare had his zenith as a writer.   In 1595 Shakespeare wrote his most famous play, Romeo and Juliet.  From 1596 to 1613 Shakespeare purchased many valuable properties in London and Stratford including one of the largest houses in Stratford, a sure sign of his extensive wealth, all gained from his work as an actor and author.  Around 1610 Shakespeare moved back to Stratford where he lived until his death.  He died April 23, 1616, the same day he is thought to have been born on.  His tomb stone, probably written by himself, reads as follows, “Good friend, for Jesus’ sake forbear to dig the dust enclosed here.  Blest be the man that spares these stones, and curst be he that moves my bones.”
              </p>
                
              <p>  Although little has been recorded during the many periods of Shakespeare’s life, there is enough known to clearly demonstrate that he was a brilliant person. With only a grade school education he became one of the greatest writers ever known. His many works stand as witness to his sheer genius. His amazing writing ability can be clearly seen in his thirty-eight plays and numerous poems that have been translated into all the major languages of the world.  What high school student has not read the works of William Shakespeare, the greatest dramatist ever?
